# Your first app 

In the last step, you made a Django Project. Now you'll make an app inside that project. I've named my app "todos". You can name yours something else.

```
python manage.py startapp todos
```

This will make a whole lot of new files and directories.

## Whaaat?

This is something that can get confusing at first. Why do we have to have a project and an app?

Django was built with modularity in mind. Apps are packages and they can be independently developed and published (and reused in different projects). An app contains application functionality.

A project is a collection of configuration and apps. 

On smaller projects (like this tutorial) it can feel a bit weird and clunky because the project has one responsibility and the app has the same responsibility. But on bigger projects, apps make a lot more sense. Django is built for scale - apps help us organise code and manage complexity.

To make this less confusing, many developers simply name their main project `config`. All the project configuration would go into the `config` directory and then all the apps get created using names that make sense for them. 

## Update the settings

Go to your project's `settings.py` file. Now add your app to the `INSTALLED_APPS` list.

Eg:
```
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    "todos",    # <<<<<<<<<  new line. Put your app there
    "django.contrib.admin",
    "django.contrib.auth",
    "django.contrib.contenttypes",
    "django.contrib.sessions",
    "django.contrib.messages",
    "django.contrib.staticfiles",
]
```

## Hello URLs and Views 

In your new app, you'll see a file named `views.py`

Paste this in and save the file:

```
from django.http import HttpResponse

def index(request):
    return HttpResponse("Hello world")
```

**Pay close attention to the next part, a lot of people skim read this and get themselves tied in a knot!**

Now make a new file in your `app` called `urls.py`. This file should be in the same directory as the `views.py` file you just worked with.

Put this inside the file:

```
from django.urls import path

from . import views

urlpatterns = [
    path("", views.index, name="index"),
]
```

You will be adding to this over time as you create more views.

Now we need to wire things up so that the project knows about the new url configuration.

Go to your project's main urls file (at `yata/urls.py`). It'll already have a bunch of stuff written in there.

Edit it so it is more like this:

```
from django.contrib import admin
from django.urls import include, path  # Changed

urlpatterns = [
    path("", include("todos.urls")),  # new line. Use your own app name
    path("admin/", admin.site.urls),
]
```

At this point you should have 2 separate `urls.py` files!

Refresh the webpage and you'll now see your hello-world page.

## Extra resources

You can learn more about url configuration here: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.1/topics/http/urls/

You don't need to be a url configuration ninja to complete this tutorial, but it is nice to be able to see what is available.

## Side quest: Renaming your project directory 

At this point we have 2 separate directories in our whole project:

```
├── manage.py
├── yata
│   ├── asgi.py
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── settings.py
│   ├── urls.py
│   └── wsgi.py
└── todos
    ├── admin.py
    ├── apps.py
    ...
```

This kind of thing can get confusing. 

An emerging common practice is to name the "project" directory something different. for example `config` (since it houses the configuration for the entire project) or `core` (for similar reasons).

You are welcome to rename your project directory at any point. There is nothing magical about the name. 

**Good code makes its intentions clear**, and if you want to choose a different name to make the code more clear then you should do that. 

For example you might want something like this:

```
├── manage.py
├── config   <<< changed from yata
│   ├── asgi.py
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── settings.py
│   ├── urls.py
│   └── wsgi.py
└── todos
    ├── admin.py
    ├── apps.py
    ...
```

Note that you will need to change the name in multiple places. If you change the name of your directory and then try to run `python manage.py runserver` then you will get error messages that will tell you what else you need to fix.

If you are using a code editor such as vscode then you should be able to find all instances of the word "yata" by using the keyboard shortcut: `Ctrl + Shift + F`
