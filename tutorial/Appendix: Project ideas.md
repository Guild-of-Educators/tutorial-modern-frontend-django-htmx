# Project ideas 

As the final phase of the workshop, you'll be building your own project. Or at least getting started. 

Past participants have made all sorts of cool things, from family chore managers, to AI powered meal planners. Many have jumped into using the skills they learned for work projects.

## Choosing a project

Try to choose something with clear CRUD functionality. CRUD stands for Create, Read, Update, Delete.  Most web applications are CRUDdy.

Think about choosing an application where you will have a page for listing out items, a form for creating new items, a button for deleting them and a way to update them. 

## Ideas

- TODO for you: build your perfect ultimate todo list tracker
- Recipe book
- book tracker
- movie tracker
- expense tracker
- log book for driving
- habit tracker
- plant care manager 
- beer batch tracker 
- learning journal
- health data tracker (temperature, weight, bp, etc)
- events/calendar
- meal prep planner (shopping lists, nutritional info)
- stock management
- bucket list tracker 
- local business listing and reviews
- digital library: free online courses 
- knowledge management: Zettles + tags + ...
- micro lending app ...

## Updating items 

The example we will be using in this tutorial is a TODO app. This application will display a list of TODO items and the user will be able to click on checkboxes to mark things as done. It would be useful if your application also had a checkbox or similar so that we can play with "events" in the browser. 

This is not critical, you will be able to learn the lessons without implementing every little thing yourself. But it would be nice if you could do this in your app.

Here are some ways you might include a checkbox or button:

- click on a star shaped checkbox to mark something as a favourite
- click on an emoji to add a reaction to an item 
- click on a button to "approve" an item
- click on a button to change the state of an item (eg: books could go from unread to read to complete)
- click on a widget to add a star rating to an item
- click on a button to give a think a higher or lower priority
